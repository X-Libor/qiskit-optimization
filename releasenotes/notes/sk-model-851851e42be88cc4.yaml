    Introduced the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model
    (for a rewiev see `Panchenko <https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1094>`_)
    :class:`qiskit_optimization.applications.SKModel`.
    The SK model Hamiltonian on :math:`n` sites is

    .. math::
    \begin{array}{}
    H(x)=-1/\sqrt{n} \sum_{i<j} w_{i,j}x_ix_j,
    \end{array}

    where :math:`i,j\in [n]`, :math:`x_i\in\{\pm 1\}` are configurations of spins,
    and :math:`w_{i,j}\in\{\pm 1\}` are called disorder and are chosen independently
    and uniformly at random.

    The computational problem asociated with this class is to find the ground state
    of the SK Hamiltonian instance and its energy.

    An instance of a 6 site SK Model can be created as::

    .. highlight:: python
    from qiskit_optimization.applications.sk_model import SKModel
    sk = SKModel(6)

    Next, one can generate a new disorder::

    .. highlight:: python
    sk.new_disorder()
