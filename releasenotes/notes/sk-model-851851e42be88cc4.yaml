    Introduced the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model :class:`qiskit_optimization.applications.SKModel`.

    The SK model Hamiltonian on :math:`n` sites is

    .. math::
        \begin{array}{}
        H(x)=-1/\sqrt{n} \sum_{i<j} w_{i,j}x_ix_j,
        \end{array}

    where :math:`i,j\in [n]`, :math:`x_i\in\{\pm 1\}` are configurations of spins,
    and :math:`w_{i,j}\in\{\pm 1\}` are called disorder and are chosen independently
    and uniformly at random.

    The computational problem associated with this class is to find the ground state
    of the SK Hamiltonian instance and its energy.
